## About the game

The Invasion is a short science fiction horror game which puts you in the shoes of an office worker caught up in the end of the world. You must make quick, smart choices to escape the office alive, find your coworkers, and avoid the mysterious creatures and otherworldly spacecrafts hunting you down. Inspired by "Alien Isolation," and "Outlast," this game aims to convey the primal instincts of fear and anxiety involved in escaping a dangerous situation.
